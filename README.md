## Prerequisites

Next.js + BigCommerce requires a [BigCommerce sandbox or store provisioned to run a headless storefront]().

<!-- ++++ TODO: configuration directions from DevDocs quickstart -->

## Develop locally

<!-- +++ TODO: clarify that deploy button & auto repo creation is great and the way to go -->

To run Next.js + BigCommerce, use the environment variables [defined in .env.example](.env.example). The best practice is to use [Vercel environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: Do not commit your `.env` file. It exposes secrets that allow others to control your BigCommerce store.

1. Install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Link your local instance with the desired Vercel and GitHub accounts. This action creates a `.vercel` directory:

```bash
vercel link
```

3. Download the [Vercel environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables):

```bash
vercel env pull
```

4. Install the app's default dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The app runs on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Get to know the BigCommerce GraphQL Storefront API

In addition to being compatible with BigCommerce's multi-storefront features, Next.js + BigCommerce uses the [GraphQL Storefront API](). This API makes it possible for merchants to control the representation of products and categories, carts, orders, customer segmentation, and more. To get a sense of what is possible to do directly on the storefront, check out the dedicated [GraphQL Playground]() for the sandbox.
